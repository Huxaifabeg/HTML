			<h2>About My Portfolio</h2>
			<p>Hello — I'm a BS Computer Science student who enjoys building small projects, learning new technologies, and sharing what I create. This portfolio collects a few of my hobbies, favorite media, and contact details so visitors can learn more about me in one place.</p>
			<p>I like coding, reading, and playing cricket, and I spend time on projects, classes, and the occasional game with friends. Feel free to explore the other pages above — if something catches your interest, the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page has ways to reach me.</p>
